- Visualize findings for a clear and informative presentation.

### Approach
- Data Cleaning: We begin by cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA techniques are employed to uncover insights, correlations, and trends in the data.
- Data Visualization: We utilize data visualization to present our findings in a visually engaging manner.
- Findings and Conclusions: The project concludes with a summary of key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.
