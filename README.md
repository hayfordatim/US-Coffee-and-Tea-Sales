### Project Overview

This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of coffee and tea sales in the United States during the years 2012 and 2013. The primary aim is to gain insights into the sales trends, market dynamics, and factors influencing the consumption of these popular beverages. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization, we unveil patterns and draw meaningful conclusions from the provided dataset.

### Key Objectives
- Examine sales trends for various coffee and tea products.
- Investigate regional variations in consumption and preferences.
- Identify factors influencing sales, such as product type and marketing efforts.
- Visualize findings for a clear and informative presentation.

### Approach
- Data Cleaning: We begin by cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA techniques are employed to uncover insights, correlations, and trends in the data.
- Data Visualization: We utilize data visualization to present our findings in a visually engaging manner.
- Findings and Conclusions: The project concludes with a summary of key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.


### Data Source


### Data Preparation

In this section, we detail the procedures undertaken to ensure the data is in optimal condition for analysis. This includes data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies, and the selection of relevant variables. The goal was to create a clean, structured dataset that formed the foundation for our exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we journey through the data, seeking to understand its structure, uncover patterns, and identify key insights. It's our first step into uncharted territory, where we let the data tell its story. Through EDA, we uncover the untold tales hidden within the data, setting the stage for further exploration and analysis.

### Data Visualization

By harnessing the power of visualization, data becomes more than just numbers; it becomes a story, allowing us to quickly grasp trends, patterns, and insights. Visualization bridges the gap between raw data and human understanding, making it an essential tool for data analysis, decision-making, and effective communication.
